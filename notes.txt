CSS TRANSITIONS

Transitions allow us to animate the transition value of one property 
value to another property value. 


Beyond hovering, that's a very common example, but in JS, 
you can always apply classes, remove classes, change styles on the fly,
and you can still add transitions to that.


So transitions are not used to only switch from one CSS property to 
another CSS property - there are many other situations.
